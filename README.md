# books-db

A simple command line application for maintaining a collection of books. It uses [ISBNdb](https://isbndb.com) as a data source and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for storage.

## Setup

Use the `init` command to create the database. On Linux, the file will be created at `~/.local/share/books-db/books.db`.
